HIDAPI MagTek Card Reader ID Swipe software
######

Works on OSX
=======

This is an HIDAPI-based MagTek ID swipe software that works on OSX.

Most of the HID drivers for python/ruby/etc for these readers only work on linux, this uses the HIDAPI library that makes it compatiable with OSX also.

Enjoy!

I wrote this because I couldn't find anything like it avaliable for OSX.

It's a possibility that I'll write a full cocoa app later on.

For now, this is really simple, just run ./cardread
